Simple Event Handler for Styling Elements
This project demonstrates a simple web application that allows users to customize the styling of an HTML element using input fields and event handlers. Users can set the height, border, width, and color of the element to see the changes in real-time.



Features:

Input fields for adjusting height, border, width, and color.
Real-time updates of the element's style as users change input values.
User-friendly interface for interactive styling.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Markup for structuring the user interface.
CSS: Styling for the user interface and the preview element.
JavaScript: Event handling and DOM manipulation for real-time updates.

Use the input fields to adjust the height, border, width, and color of the preview element.
